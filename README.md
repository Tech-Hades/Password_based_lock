# Password based lock
Password based lock system using 8051 microcontroller.
The code and the circuit diagram are included in the repository!  
<br>
The coding is done in C language using Keil uVision5 software and the compiled hex file is uploaded to the 8051 microcontroller in Proteus 8 software.  
<br>
The correct password is specified in the code and if the number of attempts to input the correct password is exceeded (here, 2 tries) then the door can only be opened after entering the master key (also specified in the code).
